Today we are going to learn about `Function Calling` in GLLMs (Generative Large Language Models).
> Instructions are given inside the program files itself.

# Step 1 (Install Packages)
You can think of package as a collection of programs to do some specific task. In this case the package name is `google-generativeai`. This package is written by google gemini developers. Using this package simplifies our interaction with google GLLMs like Gemini, Gemma.

Copy paste (or type) the following command in VS code terminal (or any terminal, if you are using codespace there is only vs code integrated terminal) and hit enter, this command will tell pip to install the google generative ai package.
```
pip install google-generativeai
```

# Step 2 (Let's Code)
There are 2 python program files in your directory (folder). Open `calculation.py` and start reading, follow the instructions to complete the program.

Try running the program using the following command, Expect some errors, because the program is incomplete, try to read and understand errors (in terminal) and try to resolve it.
```
python calculation.py
```
